I think there's a bug with the auction house. when i search for linen cloth and arange after lowest price, there's like 3+ pages of one guys 39s bid 79s buyout and then AFTER that there's prices like 10s buyout. clearly the 39s bid shouldn't be listed first when sorting for lowest price. And i had a friend check and he got the same thing.
